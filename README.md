# Daisy Pets / Mobile 🐶🐱

> 🇵🇹 [Versão em português](PORTUGUESE.MD)

## 🎯 Who Is This App For?

**Daisy Pets** is designed to be flexible and valuable for **all pet owners**, whether you have:

- 🏠 **1-5 pets at home** - Individual pet owners who want to stay organized and never miss important care dates
- 🏢 **Pet associations, shelters, or rescues** - Organizations managing multiple animals simultaneously
- 🐕‍🦺 **Professional breeders** - Those who need detailed health and lineage tracking
- 👨‍⚕️ **Pet care professionals** - Groomers, walkers, or sitters managing client pets

### Why Not Just Use Excel?

While spreadsheets work for basic tracking, **Daisy Pets** offers advantages that become apparent even with just one or two pets:

✅ **Automated Reminders** - Never forget vaccination or deworming dates with visual alerts  
✅ **Integrated Photos & Documents** - Keep vaccination certificates, vet reports, and pet photos all in one place  
✅ **Shareable Profiles** - Generate and share complete PDF pet profiles with vets or pet sitters instantly  
✅ **Mobile-First Design** - Quick access on your phone when at the vet or pet store  
✅ **Expense Tracking** - Understand your pet care costs with categorized spending reports  
✅ **Offline Access** - All data stored locally; no internet required  
✅ **Data Security** - Built-in backup and restore features protect your pet's history

### Real-World Use Cases

**Individual Owner (1-2 pets):**  
*"I use Daisy Pets to track my dog's vaccination schedule. The app alerts me 30 days before shots are due, and I can share his complete medical PDF with the boarding kennel with one tap."*

**Small Rescue Organization (10-20 animals):**  
*"We manage medical records for all our rescue cats and dogs. When adopters come, we can instantly show them the complete care history and share a PDF profile."*

**Large Shelter (50+ animals):**  
*"Daisy Pets helps us coordinate care across multiple staff members. Everyone can see upcoming appointments, expenses, and health status at a glance."*

 ## 🚀 1. Building the APK for your MAUI Project (.NET MAUI)

Follow these steps to build the APK file and install it on your Android device.

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- .NET MAUI project targeting Android
- Android SDK and .NET MAUI workload installed

---

### 2️⃣ Step-by-Step Guide

#### 🟢 2.1 Ensure APK Package Format

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your main MAUI project (e.g., `MauiPets`).
2. Select **Properties**.
3. Go to **Android > Options** tab.
4. In the **Release** field, select **apk** (default is aab).
   - This ensures you’ll generate an APK (installable), not an AAB (for Play Store).

---

#### 🟢 2.2 Choose Deployment Target

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, use the **Debug Target** drop-down to select **Android Emulators** and then your preferred emulator (or leave it for a physical device).

---

#### 🟢 2.3 Select Release Configuration

1. In the toolbar, use the **Solution Configuration** drop-down to switch from **Debug** to **Release**.

---

#### 🟢 2.4 Create Distribution Archive

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your main MAUI project.
2. Select **Publish...**.
3. Visual Studio will open the **Archive Manager** and begin archiving your APK.

---

#### 🟢 2.5 Once Archive is Created, Distribute the APK

1. In **Archive Manager**, select the newly created archive when archiving is complete.
2. Click the **Distribute...** button.
3. In the **Distribute - Select Channel** dialog, select **Ad Hoc**.

---

#### 🟢 2.6 Signing Identity (Keystore)

1. In the **Distribute - Signing Identity** dialog, click the **+** button to create a new signing identity (or **Import** to use an existing one).

   - **Validity**: Set how many years the key is valid.

   - Click **Create**.
3. The keystore is saved at:  
   `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Xamarin\Mono for Android\Keystore\{Alias}\{Alias}.keystore`

> **Important:**  
> The keystore and password are not saved with your Visual Studio solution. Back them up! Losing them means you can’t sign future versions with the same identity.

---

#### 🟢 2.7 Select Identity and Save APK

1. Back in the **Distribute - Signing Identity** dialog, select your newly created signing identity.
2. Click **Save As...** to choose the location and filename for the APK.

3. Enable **Install apps from unknown sources**.
4. In your file manager, locate the APK and tap to install.

### ⚠️ Important Notes
